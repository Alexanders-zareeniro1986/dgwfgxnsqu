Whoa. Oh man, just stepped out of Phule and it's like my brain's been through a blender half full of popcorn. Can barely imagine why it's still roaringly noisy in here but also quiet like... like that feeling of your own voice when you plug your ears at a loud concert. Or maybe like when you're on a rollercoaster and it stops, but your heart's still doing cartwheels inside.

So the  , Phule, right? Like, I don't kno: it was bright, blinding sometimes — that scene with the birds, oh my god, the way they took over the entire screen. What was that about?? Felt like they were gonna fly right out and perch on my shoulder or like... pop out from under the armrest with the crumbs. I swear there're popcorn graves in these theater chairs.

And um, yeah, remember the dialogue when — oh what was his name, the main dude with the eyes like they're seeing through three dimensions of chaos? They said something, something kind of profound as hell, but all I can recall is the echo of it, the way my own brain repeated it like a mantra till the next explosion on screen. And there were lots. Explosions, I mean.

> Someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but, you know, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it in a theater for the full-blast experience. Like, everything everywhere was just... alive. Stop me if I'm making sense. That moment when— they really knew how to mess with your head, swirling those colors like a kid with finger paints gone rogue.

The guy two seats down was laughing too hard at the wrong scenes, and that one bit where the chair felt like it was permanently fused with my lower back. And some scenes felt like they were shot in my own dreams, bizarrely intimate yet utterly alien. Wish I could recall more clearly but it's like trying to catch glitter on a windy day. Slips right through.

And for some wild reason, there's a part of my mind saying something vague like the mating ritual of confused penguins — cause that awkward dance in the middle of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 just got to me. And can we talk about the soundtrack? Seriously, it's the kind of jam you'd want while cooking scrambled eggs with your non-dominant hand.

Anyway, uh— Yeah, get it, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . You probably won’t get it either but that’s half the fun, huh? My brain is still in ten different directions and for some reason, my knees are still reliving that long sit. Gotta catch my breath.

```c
int main() {
  // why is this here?
  return 0; // how's this gonna work?
}
